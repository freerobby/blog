<p>I wrote this song for the purpose of trying GarageBand for iPad this evening. I used vocals, guitars and virtual instruments in ways that I believe most people would use them, and I capped the project at two hours.</p>

<h2 id="composition">Composition</h2>

<p>The above song was recorded entirely on a <strong>first generation iPad</strong>. It consists of eight virtual tracks: two recorded acoustic guitars, two recorded vocal tracks, two recorded electric guitars, a virtual bass, and a virtual drumkit. All audio tracks were recorded with the iPad’s internal condenser microphone.</p>

<p><img src="http://robby-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2011/garageband-has-found-its-interface/Final_Track_Layout.png" alt="Final Track Layout" /></p>

<h2 id="recording-process">Recording Process</h2>

<p>The two acoustic guitar tracks are panned about 75% left and 75% right. The left is strumming chords; the right is alternating between chords and arpeggiated notes. I chose the “small room” preset for both to provide ambiance.</p>

<p>The two vocal tracks are separate takes of the same lines, panned about two thirds left and two thirds right. This process provides a full sound without requiring any unnatural reverb (Elliott Smith is perhaps best known for using this technique; John Lennon and Bon Iver have also employed it).</p>

<p>The two electric guitar tracks are panned about 60% each way. These are not virtual instruments; they are real electric guitars played through a Fender Pro Junior amp. I struggled to maintain a consistent volume because even at 15 watts my Pro Junior was too loud for the iPad’s internal mic. I got the levels manageable with a makeshift damper made from tissues.</p>

<p>I created the virtual bass lines by plucking individual strings from chords in the selected key. Non-musicians will appreciate this method because they can improvise without the risk of playing out of key. Musicians, and particularly composers, will find this limiting. There were a couple times when I wanted to create dissonance, and had to change the key in order to pluck an intermediate semitone.</p>

<p><img src="http://robby-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2011/garageband-has-found-its-interface/Virtual_Bass.png" alt="GarageBand Virtual Bass" /></p>

<p>The virtual drumkit is by far the most fun part of creating songs. GarageBand provides two ways to lay down your beats:</p>

<p>The first is a clickable drumset that plays the drum you tap at the time you tap it. Overdubs are allowed within a single track, so you can focus on one drum per take and get the timing right. If you have a specific drumbeat in your head, this is the method you’ll need to use to translate it for the virtual drumset. GarageBand lets you quantize virtual instruments (up to the nearest 64th note), so you can stay on rhythm even if your hands aren’t perfect.</p>

<p>The other means of entry is a grid onto which you place drums. The grid ranges from simple to complex and from quiet to loud. If you want to experiment with beats or just get a rhythm down to record with (metronomes are boring), this is the quickest way to get up and running. You can also click the die to generate a random beat.</p>

<p><img src="http://robby-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2011/garageband-has-found-its-interface/Virtual_Drums.png" alt="GarageBand Virtual Drums" /></p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>GarageBand has found its interface (spoiler: it comes in a 9.7” version, but not 13”, 15” or 17”). Buttons that you actually push. Sliders that you actually slide. Drums that you actually hit. Good riddance, mouse; you will not be missed. It feels like this is what the iPad was made to do.</p>

<p>But the impressiveness of the interface is only half of why GarageBand for iPad is so great. The other half is that Apple has proven that the whole of the iPad is greater than the sum of its parts. It isn’t that the GarageBand keyboard has better sensitivity and sound than Pianist (though it does), or that the virtual guitar is easier to use than Air Guitar (though it is), or that the beat sequencers are easier to use than Korg’s iElectribe (though they are), or that the drums sound better than those of JamPad (though they do), or that the recording interface is smoother than FourTrack’s (though it is). It’s that all of these things are now integrated perfectly into part of a larger whole. It is an all-in-one-piece music creation suite, and it is the most capable one on the market.</p>

<p>The closest competition it has is the <a href="http://www.bossus.com/gear/productdetails.php?ProductId=818">Boss Micro BR</a>, which trails far behind in several respects. GarageBand is easy and intuitive to use while the Micro BR’s functionality is arcane; GarageBand supports eight tracks while the Micro BR supports only four; GarageBand provides several virtual instruments while the Micro BR provides none. The Micro BR is smaller (5.5”x3.25x0.875”), which makes it slightly more portable, but this also contributes to its poor usability. My Micro BR has served me well for years. Tomorrow it goes up on Craigslist.</p>

<p><img src="http://robby-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2011/garageband-has-found-its-interface/micro-br.jpg" alt="Boss Micro BR" /></p>

<h2 id="room-for-improvement">Room for Improvement</h2>

<p>I’d like to see an input level adjustment in the next version. Controlling individual track volumes at playback time is not sufficient for this purpose, especially for songs that vary from quiet vocals to loud, distorted guitars.</p>

<p>A more traditional drum machine interface (with individual tracks for each drum laid out on a timeline) would be helpful for creating drumbeats that exist in my head. The touch sensitivity of the on-screen drumset is impressive but imperfect. It’s frustrating to get through 14 out of 16 measures and then miss a beat.</p>

<p>The condenser mic in my iPad (again, first generation) is acceptable, but leaves something to be desired, particularly on the high end. I don’t know if this mic has been upgraded in the iPad2, but something of higher quality would be much appreciated. In the mean the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphones-Yeti-USB-Microphone/dp/B002VA464S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1300250784&amp;sr=8-1">Blue Yeti</a> is an excellent USB microphone, and works with the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC531ZM/A">camera connection kit</a>. Obviously, this makes the setup much less portable.</p>

<h2 id="a-note-on-ipad-vs-ipad-2-performance">A Note on iPad vs iPad 2 Performance</h2>

<p>GarageBand’s performance on my first generation iPad was noticeably but not painfully sluggish. The most frequent lag occurs when switching between the track and recording screens. It lasts for about one second.</p>

<p>There is another lag, longer in duration but less frequent in occurrence, that I ran into seemingly arbitrarily. A box will pop up that says “Optimizing Performance” and you will have to wait 15-20 seconds while it chugs along. I encountered this four or five times over the course of two hours. I suspect what GarageBand is doing is loading audio content into and out of RAM. If that’s the case, then performance should be better on the iPad 2, which has 512MB as opposed to the 256MB of the original.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>GarageBand for iPad is the most complete and capable all-in-one music creation package available anywhere. It’s fun, it’s easy, and it’s effective. At $4.99, it has replaced my $220 Micro BR.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Among the highlights from <a href="/2008/jon-brion-the-harris-theater">Jon Brion’s New Year’s Eve show</a> was an impromptu impression of Bruce Springsteen–in the form of a fake Bruce Springsteen song.<!--more--></p>

<p>An audibly-apt Brion fan over at <a href="http://www.fairfax-avenue.com">Fairfax Ave</a> has done his best to transcribe the lyrics. If you can make out any parts that he couldn’t, post a comment and I’ll update them accordingly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well I came from the burbs of Jersey one day when it was [turnin?]<br />
I moved down to ?<br />
I met a pretty good lover under the boardwalk and we made love<br />
I thought that was all this world was made of<br />
We thought if we could have ? highway ?<br />
And I swear that Jenny, I couldn’t have a worry anymore<br />
It was knowing you’re the one with the fire in your heart</p>

  <p>I knew it from the start<br />
So come on, come on, come on<br />
Baby wanna drink it up<br />
I came all the way from Jersey<br />
You’re the only girl that I’m dreaming of<br />
Nothing that you ever do could drive me away<br />
That’s all I got,<br />
That’s all I’m gonna say</p>

  <p>[Sensitive piano breakdown, really high]</p>

  <p>Now I know what you wanted, you want ? prom<br />
And I’m gonna take that jacket, everything that I’m about<br />
You know it’s fat happy Pete<br />
He went down to the convenience store<br />
He’s only living for a six pack, he don’t live for nothing more<br />
Well get in to my car it’s a Dodge and it’s got heat<br />
We’ll make love in the front and in the back seat<br />
And there ain’t noone in this world who’s ever gonna hold us back<br />
? [architect?]</p>

  <p>I come from Jersey,<br />
I come from Jersey,<br />
I come form Jersey,<br />
I come from Jersey,<br />
And let me tell you,<br />
Let me tell you without a doubt<br />
There’s not that much to sing about</p>

  <p>Whoah-oh…</p>

    <link href="http://rob.by/2008/jon-brion-the-harris-theater/"/>
    <updated>2008-01-03T02:10:40-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://rob.by/2008/jon-brion-the-harris-theater</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve never been one to question Jon Brion’s musical prowess. In addition to completing <a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/jonbrion">a self-released solo CD</a>, he’s produced such artists as <a href="http://www.sweetadeline.net">Elliott Smith</a>, <a href="http://www.fiona-apple.com/">Fiona Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.aimeemann.com/">Aimee Mann</a> and <a href="http://www.rufuswainwright.com">Rufus Wainwright</a>, all of whom asked Jon to make the most of their songs. And if you haven’t heard any of those artists’ work, you’ve likely still heard Brion–at the movie theater. He’s done the soundtracks for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Punch-Drunk-Love-Score-Brion/dp/B00006YXF6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1199339174&amp;sr=1-1">Punch-Drunk Love</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Magnolia-Score-1999-Film-Brion/dp/B00004S2W3/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1199339174&amp;sr=1-2">Magnolia</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eternal-Sunshine-Spotless-Various-Artists/dp/B0001IXU1W/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1199339174&amp;sr=1-4">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Heart-Huckabees-Score-Jason-Schwartzman/dp/B00049QKZG/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1199339386&amp;sr=1-1">I Heart Huckabees</a>. Hip Hop star <a href="http://www.kanyeuniversecity.com/">Kanye West</a> was so impressed by Jon’s soundtrack work that he sought Jon to produce part of <a href="http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/7478247/a/Graduation.htm">his latest album</a>. And when Jon’s not making music, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Jon+Brion+Interview&amp;btnG=Search">he’s talking about it</a>. To me it seems as though Jon has always been in a musical bubble, floating high above the pedestals of the other musicians I admire, far, far away from me.</p>

<p>But last night I saw him up close and personal, and with a personality aimed to entertain and a humbleness as if he were one of the audience members, too. When he wasn’t banging on drums or striking keys or programming a synthesizer or strumming a guitar or plucking bass notes or singing, he was cracking jokes, telling stories, impersonating Bruce Springsteen or inviting audience members up on stage–either to sing, play an instrument or request a song. There were moments in which the show seemed a small step away from Open Mic Night with Jon Brion.<!--more--></p>

<p><img src="http://robby-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2008/jon-brion-the-harris-theater/jon-brion.jpg" alt="Jon Brion" /></p>

<p>But it was controlled, and Jon was, as expected of any perfectionist, very precise. He has to be. When you’re playing five different instruments in the same song, looping one on top of the others, there’s no room for error. Hit that bass drum one extra time and you’ve changed the time signature. Hit a wrong note on the Piano and you’ll be going out of key every four measures until the song is over. A one-man-band bears all the responsibility for what happens on stage. Perhaps that’s why Jon likes it; he certainly thrived on it.</p>

<p>I’d heard of Brion’s live antics long before I saw them in 2007’s final hours, but I didn’t grasp the extent of his on-stage creativity until seeing it. After a Beatles cover and some audience requests, Jon was playing musical mad libs–combining genres, artists and individual songs (all chosen by the audience, mind you), into a single musical performances. The setlist is unknown until after the show–even to Jon. And in a sense, that’s how it has to be for Jon to be Jon. If he had a setlist before the show, is there any chance we’d have had that Bohemian Rhapsody sing-along?</p>

<p>Having listened to every recorded piece of Jon’s music that I’ve been able to get my hands on, I went in knowing of Jon’s gilt-edged musical talent. But what I didn’t know was how personable, energetic, funny and clever he is as a performer. The combination of these qualities created what was resoundingly the most spectacular performance I’ve ever seen. Never before have I gone into an event with such high expectations, and never before have those expectations been so far surpassed.</p>

    <link href="http://rob.by/2007/musical-shareware/"/>
    <updated>2007-10-02T12:26:55-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://rob.by/2007/musical-shareware</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.radiohead.com">Radiohead</a> announced earlier this week that they would be selling their new album on October 10 for whatever price their listeners would like to pay. The mainstream media covered this so extensively that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7024130.stm">excessive traffic caused the band’s web site to crash</a>.</p>

<p>But the idea isn’t so new. In December of 1999, Jon Brion was asked, “As a musician, are you afraid of the internet?” His <a href="http://www.neverisapromise.com/interviews/EQ1299.htm">response</a> was prophetic (emphasis mine):<!--more--></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No, I’ve been looking forward to this. Twelve years ago, I programmed Fairlights at a studio in Connecticut and realized - because of the way information was stored - that there was a big change coming. Right now, everyone is trying to figure out ways to protect material and how to procure money from the Internet. I think it’s much more socialistic than that. For most artists, the question is general subsidy. We sign record deals because it’s the only subsidy that is offered. We no longer live in the Age of Kings, where the artist might live for free at the castle and write some minuets.<strong>I have always been interested in the notion that if you wanted to release what you have done - to the entire world - just to do it, and now we have the technology to do so. The artist can say, “I am going to offer this for free. I don’t care.”</strong> I am interested in seeing people move away from the plan to put a grid on the Internet, to do massive accounting.</p>

  <p><strong>Here is my concept, which is an unlikely scenario because it requires human cooperation. It would run like shareware. You assume that most people are going to pirate the material, but if you look at the truth of the music, you see it has the potential to genuinely touch people and perhaps change the course of their lives, or at least that given day. There are enough of us in the population who are happy to support those who affect us. The amount of money I have paid out over my lifetime to “give” to the artist is considerable. The music has enriched my life and I give back, but they don’t see any of it.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>By releasing records independently over the Internet, there is a fair chance that the artist might see some return.</strong> I think it should go one step further. Fuck it. Obliterate the new smaller, kinder companies because they will just become evil in nanoseconds anyway. Anybody who doesn’t think so is an idiot. <strong>Let’s do shareware, and in this Internet honor system, maybe 10 percent will honor it. If you fall in love with a record, it is something you live with for months. Why wouldn’t you send back five or ten dollars directly to the artist?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a band that has already seen profound success, it’s much easier for Radiohead to pull off this move than it would be for an unheard-of artist. However, that’s not to say that the RIAA shouldn’t feel threatened. If people download Radiohead’s new album in as big numbers as they have previously purchased Radiohead’s CDs, and if the average downloaded pays so much as a dollar, Radiohead will stand to make more money than they have on any previous album.</p>

<p>In an internet world where the most widely-used sites are free of charge to end-users, they’re able to gain traction quickly. One has to wonder how soon we’ll see a new service that allows artists to sell tracks for whatever their fans would like to pay.</p>

<p>Such a service could give the RIAA a run for its money while leaving even more in the hands of those who have most earned it: the artists.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since posting my cover of Elliott Smith’s <em>Tomorrow Tomorrow</em> on YouTube a few months ago, I’ve received several requests for help from enthusiastic guitarists looking to learn the song themselves. Rather than address everybody in a brief reply, I thought I would make a thorough post explaining how I learned to play the more difficult parts of the song. If this post doesn’t cut it, let me know! I’ll be happy to field any further questions that you may have (post them as comments to this blog entry so that I see them when I go to make edits).<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="tuning-studio-vs-live">Tuning: Studio vs Live</h2>

<p>I play this in standard tuning down one full step. D-G-C-F-A-D. I’ll explain what Elliott did in detail later, but for now, that’s all you need to know.</p>

<h2 id="intro-000-021">Intro (0:00-0:21)</h2>

<p>The intro is done with tremolo-picking using your thumb, middle and index (pointer) fingers. I suggest using this process to learn it.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Break the rhythm into triplets. 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3. This triplet pattern is the foundation of the tremolo picking that Elliott employs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of thinking “1-2-3, 1-2-3,” think “t-m-i, t-m-i” (meaning “thumb-middle-index, thumb-middle-index”). This is the right-hand order in which you will be plucking the strings. <strong>This is important!</strong> Doing t-m-i, t-m-i will make your life a lot easier than doing, say, t-i-m, t-i-m. The reason for this has to do with the respective lengths of your fingers and the motion that you will employ as described in the next step. Get this pattern down before picking up the guitar. Tap on a table with your right hand if it helps. Thumb-middle-index, thumb-middle-index.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For each triplet, think of your right hand as making a single sweep. The motion is identical to that as though you are closing your hand and grabbing onto something. Begin each sweep with the thumb (alternating between the G and B strings as indicated in the tab). The pull from your thumb will draw your middle and index fingers up against the high E string. Start slow, preferably with a metronome, and work your way up to tempo. Pay close attention to evenly timing your notes, and only play as fast as you can in proper rhythm. Don’t worry about speed, we’ll work on that in the next step.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Build your speed slowly. If you have a metronome it’s a great way to monitor and force yourself to build speed at a manageable rate. If not, you need to be careful not to speed up or slow down drastically. This often happens when you are simply playing as fast as you can, so be aware of it! Keep your hand as relaxed as possible, and pay attention to make sure that you’re not flexing your forearm or your bicep. Flexing muscles will make you tense, making it more difficult to play fast. Also, keep your wrist and the rest of your hand up off of the strings while you play. As a reference point, Elliott plays the intro at about 78 beats per minute on <em>XO</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn the left-hand in pieces, not all at once! The impressive part of the intro is no doubt in the right hand, so don’t get hung up elsewhere while learning it. Learn the first measure, then the second. Work on that for 10 minutes, an hour, a day, however long it takes you to get it down, not necessarily at full tempo, but at consistent rhythm. Then learn the third and fourth and so on. The left hand will come easily as you progress with the right hand.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="verse-pt-1-021-042">Verse Pt 1 (0:21-0:42)</h2>

<p>“Everybody knows which way you go…”</p>

<p>The first part of the verse is played in conventional two-part classical style. The thumb is used to pick the bass notes on the low E, A, D and G strings. The index and middle fingers are used to pick the syncopated notes on the B and high E strings, respectively.</p>

<p>I’m not sure that there is a “correct” fingering to the ending riff of this part of the verse. In the video, I play the end riff with absolute right-hand alternation of my thumb and index finger.</p>

<h2 id="verse-pt-2-042-102">Verse Pt 2 (0:42-1:02)</h2>

<p>“I heard the hammer at the lock…”</p>

<p>Continuing the right hand technique, I use absolute alternation, switching between my thumb and index finger here. The timing works out such that the thumb hits all notes on the A and G strings while the index finger gets all the notes on the B string.</p>

<p>The ending riff in this part of the verse is identical to the one that ends the first part of the verse.</p>

<h2 id="verse-pt-3-102-126">Verse Pt 3 (1:02-1:26)</h2>

<p>“The noise is coming out, and if it’s not out now…”</p>

<p>The right-hand work here is no more difficult than in the previous parts, but it is slightly less predictable and intuitive. It’s probably easiest to just look at the video to see how I pick it, but the “pattern” is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>T-M-T-I-T-M-T-M-T-I-T-thumb strum-T-thumb strum</p>
  </li>
  <li>

          <td>B7</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="bridge-126-152">Bridge (1:26-1:52)</h2>

<p>The bridge begins by alternating an open low E string with various octaves as indicated in the tab. I play this part by fingerpicking the thumb on the low E string in a downward motion and playing the syncopated octave licks in an upward-motion strum.</p>

<p>As far as the rest of the bridge goes, I think the easiest way for you to learn it is to watch me play it, follow along with the tab, and then give it a whirl yourself. I don’t have any particular advice, but I’d be happy to answer any specific questions that you have.</p>

<h2 id="outro-152-243">Outro (1:52-2:43)</h2>

<p>“I’ve got static in my head, the reflected sound of everything…”</p>

<p>The outro is nearly identical to Verse, Pt 2. The only difference is that the last time through Elliott moves through the C chord slightly differently (as indicated in the tab), and rather than fall to the E chord as normal, he lands on the same B7 chord that he used to bring us into the bridge. Again, if you have any specific questions, ask ‘em!</p>

<h2 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>Thanks to Fat Brian Wilson for posting the original powertab off of which I based the tab for my performance, to my mother for teaching me the art of classical tremolo picking, and to Elliott for among many things, raising the bar for my own playing. I’d also like to thank those of you who asked me to post this lesson and those who nagged me about it to the point of completion.</p>
