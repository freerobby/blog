<div class="entry-content"><p>I recently replaced my work and home keyboards with the <a href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/advantage.htm">Kinesis Advantage</a>. These are my collected thoughts on it after two full months of daily use.<!--more--></p>

<h2>Adjustment Period</h2>

<p>Adjusting to the Kinesis Advantage layout took some time. It is not a typical ergonomic keyboard, and the differences are more than the separated hand positions. It spaces and aligns the keys differently. Many non-alphanumeric keys have different positions. Even if you have perfect typing habits, you will suffer during the break-in period.</p>

<p>The good news is that the pain ends quickly. For alphanumeric keys, I was back to my normal speed within a week. For special keys (chiefly command, option, control, tilda, backspace) it took me two to three weeks to reach full speed. The arrow keys were particularly difficult to adjust to; they required a full month.</p>

<h2>Comfort</h2>

<p>My previous keyboard was a standard Apple chiclet model. I&#8217;ve always had minor wrist discomfort, but the Apple Keyboard brought out the worst of it. It became unbearable. I had to rest and flex my hands after only 20 minutes of typing. Using a computer had become unsustainable. When I heard about the Kinesis, I read as many detailed reviews as I could find online (not many). I then talked to my friends @zapnap and @nirvdrum, both Kinesis owners, who had nothing but nice things to say about it. I took the plunge.</p>

<p>What a world of difference. Two months later <strong>my wrist pain is gone</strong>. Not only does it feel better when I type, but also when I play guitar and piano. There were certain discomforts that I had grown accustom to over the years, which I had accepted as common or inevitable. Yet after just two months with the Kinesis they are gone. I began feeling relief within a couple of days. My wrists gradually felt better for a little over a month until the pain was entirely gone. In hindsight I cannot believe I waited so long to do something about it.</p>

<h2>Typing Speed</h2>

<p>My typing speed has also benefited. Part of this is because my hands are more relaxed and I can hit the keys faster, but mostly it&#8217;s because my hands don&#8217;t travel as far for routine tasks. I don&#8217;t have to move my right hand to use arrow keys; I no longer have to place my pinky, middle finger and thumb into an awkward position to hit control+command+3; I no longer need my pinky to press backspace (overuse of the pinky stresses tendons, which can lead to wrist pain). <strong>The Kinesis layout, once I became used to it, proved much more efficient than a traditional qwerty layout</strong>.</p>

<h2>Macros</h2>

<p>The Kinesis takes an optional footswich ($35), which I highly recommend. It allows you to activate the number pad in a hands-free manner. It also gives you quick access to your custom macros.</p>

<p>I did not expect to use macros, but they have proven very useful for inputting certain keyboard shortcuts. For instance, I have an app called MercuryMover that moves windows to preset locations. It is activated by pressing control+command+up. This is awkward and difficult to remember. Instead, I have a custom mapping to footswitch+w, which triggers that series of keys.</p>

<h2>Quirks</h2>

<p>There are a few things about the keyboard that I would change if I had the chance:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It&#8217;s loud. Clickety-clack is unavoidable when using it.</p></li>
<li><p>Macros cannot be listed, backed up or restored. If you overwrite them, they&#8217;re gone. If you forget one, there&#8217;s no means to recall it.</p></li>
<li><p>There are no finger placement indentations on the &#8220;f&#8221; and &#8220;j&#8221; keys. The Kinesis has a unique feel to it that in my opinion renders these unnecessary, but I missed them until I fully adjusted.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Answers to Anticipated Questions</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Dvorak legends are available.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don&#8217;t like the default layout, you can map any key to any other key.</p></li>
<li><p>Look for <a href="http://208.84.117.151/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&amp;Category_Code=CKBDUSB%28R%29">refurbs</a>! I saved $60 per keyboard by choosing this option. It looks brand new and carries the full warranty.</p></li>
<li><p>In my opinion the Pro model is not worth the cost difference. The memory provided for macros on the standard model is plenty.</p></li>
<li><p>The foam wrist pads (included) are a nice touch. They are definitely more comfortable than the bare plastic.</p></li>
<li><p>I have no issues switching between a Kinesis and a traditional keyboard. I routinely use my MacBook&#8217;s built-in keyboard when I travel.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>If you&#8217;re considering buying a Kinesis, feel free to ask questions in the comments of this post and I will respond to them.</p>
