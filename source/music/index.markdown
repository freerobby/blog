## Audio Recordings

### So Susie Stopped Sleeping (original)

This was my first original song that I deemed worthy of recording to completion. After laying down the ideas and foundation in May 2005 I recorded it on my four-track cassette recorder in November. This version was recorded on Sept 25, 2006 on a Tascam 2488.

### Garage Band Jam (original)

When GarageBand for iPad came out in March of 2011, I wrote and recorded this song to put it to the test. Everything was recorded directly on the device using the built-in microphone. I wrote about it in longer form [here](/2011/garageband-has-found-its-interface/).

### Condor Ave (Elliott Smith)

This is the first cover that I finished recording. I recorded it in my college dorm room in 2005, using Guitar Tracks Pro and two AKG C1000s microphones.
