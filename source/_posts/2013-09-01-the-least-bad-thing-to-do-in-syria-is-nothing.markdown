As I scanned my Facebook and Twitter feeds yesterday, I found a lot of people talking about potential US involvment in Syria. The arguments of those who want the United States to respond militarily largely echo the three rationales Obama [provided](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/transcript-president-obamas-aug-31-statement-on-syria/2013/08/31/3019213c-125d-11e3-b4cb-fd7ce041d814_story.html) yesterday:

> I’m confident we can hold the Assad regime accountable for their use of chemical weapons, deter this kind of behavior, and degrade their capacity to carry it out.

What worries me about this rationale is that it appeals to our hearts over our brains. All of the things that Obama said sound noble. But observed alongside the facts on the ground and the proposed tactics, none shows promise of saving lives nor improving the odds of a desirable outcome in Syria's Civil War.

The argument to hold Assad "accountable" is at best a misnomer. Obama is not advocating that we bring Assad to justice. He is not advocating that we overthrow him. He is advocating that we lob bombs at the Syrian military's infrastructure to send a message that we don't condone Assad's behavior. Guess what: Assad already knows this, and he doesn't care. Let us appreciate the irony, meanwhile, that the United States is debating the use of literal bombs to send a symbolic message to someone who will not be personally hurt by such an attack, and who has a [history](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/human-rights-watch/syria-local-residents-use_b_1380609.html) of lining targets with women and children.

"Degrading" Assad's ability to carry out chemical weapons attacks sounds nice, but in practice it's a completely arbitrary goal whose impact on casualties would be minimal. Chemical weapons account for [1-2%](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/even-after-100000-deaths-in-syria-chemical-weapons-attack-evoked-visceral-response/2013/08/31/de6c2b3e-1277-11e3-b4cb-fd7ce041d814_story.html) of those killed in the conflict. Obviously all deaths are horrible, but it's not clear to me why these 1-2% are more substantial than the other 98-99%. That chemical weapons happen to violate the current, always evolving rules of war is but a technicality as far as Syria's body count is concerned. If we want to prevent mass murder, we should debate that and we should acknowledge why we are doing it; it is absurd and degrading to build an international case that Assad's crime is merely that he chose the wrong murder weapon.

The goal of "deterring" Assad from using chemical weapons by intimidating him with military might won't work because our committment is a bluff, and he knows it. What happens if the United States bombs Assad's regime, and then he uses chemical weapons again? Will we ramp things up and put boots on the ground to stop him? No - Obama acknowledged this himself ("We would not put boots on the ground."). The only way a policy of intimidation can work is if Assad has reason to believe the United States would escalate things upon his continued wrongdoing. Both sides know that the US has better things to do than play chicken with sociopathic foreign leaders. Assad is a rational actor, and is going to do whatever he can to maintain power; the bombing of a few of his military sites won't alter that calculus.

Finally, on top of what Obama argued explicitly, we'd be wise to acknowledge what he said implicitly by refusing to take sides or advocate for regime change: in Syria, the enemies of our enemies are… our enemies. The rebel fighters are [organized through extremist Islam, and have deep links to Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-29/al-qaeda-links-cloud-syrian-war-as-u-s-seeks-clarity-on-rebels.html). We have no more incentive to see them succeed than we do Assad. Obama's rationale should not be interpreted as a tacit tip of the cap to the rebels; it is not, and if it were, we would be all the more misguided for it.

Wanting to do something about the atrocities in Syria is a dignified mentality, but actually going to war without an expectation of accomplishment is a fool's errand for feel-goodery. Even Obama, who strongly advocates for an intervention, has been careful to avoid calling this a peacekeeping mission. The sad truth is that despite our military strength, we are powerless to limit the body bags. All we are capable of delivering is some symbolism, and that's not a good enough reason to get involved in someone else's Civil War.
