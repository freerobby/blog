Lots of people are upset about Joe Paterno's death right now. Lots of other people don't understand how anybody can be upset given his inactions amid the Sandusky scandal.

I don't understand why people are so insistent on remembering Paterno in a particular light.<!--more--> 

I'm still shocked by the whole story, and I have a lot of difficulty and clashing emotions contrasting the Paterno I knew about with the Paterno I just learned about. I can't summon a single emotion that encapsulates these two very dichotomous narratives. The bad doesn't cancel out the good, and the good doesn't cancel out the bad. It is what it is; he was who he was.

People are complex creatures. I honor the good he did and I loathe what he allowed to happen, all at the same time.
