categories: [Business]

Apple [announced](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/03/19Apple-Announces-Plans-to-Initiate-Dividend-and-Share-Repurchase-Program.html) today it would begin paying a $2.65 quarterly dividend.

Cost of dividend: 932.4M shares outstanding * $2.65/quarter/share = **$2.47B/quarter**

Cost of a majority stake in Netflix*: $6.36B market cap / 2 = **$3.18B**

For two quarters' dividends, Apple could buy 77% of Netflix.<!--more-->

This dividend is good PR and CNBC fodder, but as an investor I'd prefer my investment be invested.
