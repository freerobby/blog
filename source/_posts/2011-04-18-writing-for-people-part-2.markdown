title: Writing for People, Part 2
categories: [Business, Startups]
---

Last year I [wrote](/2010/writing-for-people) about the importance of writing for people rather than search engines, two target audiences that often compete with each other on the web.

A similar problem occurs when authors write for companies instead of people. I see this most at business-to-business companies, where the customer is another company rather than a human. It's important to remember that it's always a human who will be reading your copy.<!--more-->

One way to make that easier is to imagine the people who are reading your copy. Conjuring that image forces you to speak to them on their terms. I think a leading cause of corporate nonsense speak is the  failure of copywriters to personify the audience they're talking to.

For the benefit of my [Executive Speaking](http://www.extension.harvard.edu/courses/spch.jsp#e-130) classmates, many of whom work at big business-to-business companies, I decided to make my final semester speech on this topic.

The slides contain several examples, citing both successes and failures. You can [download them](http://robby-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/2011/writing-for-people-part-2/Writing-for-People.pdf) or view them below.

A few of my examples came from UX Designer [Natasha Lloyd](http://www.natashascorner.com/). Specific citations are at the bottom of each applicable slide.
