I understand the outrage over gun laws right now, but gun control is distracting us from a bigger problem: **too many of our citizens are inspired to commit acts of violence**.<!--more-->

Gun control is a bandaid. What do you do when you get cut? You put on a bandaid. But what would you do if you got cut regularly and repeatedly? Would you single-handedly keep Johnson & Johnson in business for decades? No, you'd think "Hey, I keep cutting myself! I should stop cutting myself!"

That's what we need to do now, in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook tragedy. We need to stop cutting ourself and fix the underlying problem.

The underlying problem is that people want to perform these atrocities. They want to commit mass murder against toddlers and teenagers. [More than half of them don't care about the consequences because they plan to die among their victims](http://m.motherjones.com/politics/2012/11/jared-loughner-mass-shootings-mental-illness). This alone merits treatment and our full attention. We should not accept that people will want to do these things. We should not limit our protective approach to denying them the capability to carry out their attacks. It's not sustainable. There will always be ways to hurt people.

If we need gun control as a bandaid to mend our wounds in the short term, so be it. But if that's the political goal we're rallying around -- if the bar is set that low for our societal progress -- then we've already lost the larger battle, because we're conceding that we will regularly have born-and-raised Americans who want to commit mass murder against other Americans.
