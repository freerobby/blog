I'm looking for partners for my 2013 Red Sox season ticket share. If you're interested in going to Red Sox games next year, and you don't want to pay the box office fees, fill out the form and I'll be in touch.<!--more-->

Seats are subject to change, but are currently infield grandstand, sec. 29, row 3 (behind third base).

Each game is $95; that price includes both of the two seats.
