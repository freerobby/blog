I'm looking for partners for my 2013 Red Sox season ticket share. If you're interested in going to Red Sox games next year, and you don't want to pay the box office fees, fill out the form and I'll be in touch.<!--more-->

The seats are subject to change, but are currently infield grandstand, sec. 29, row 3 (behind third base). These seats are rain-covered, in the shade, and are not "obstructed view." However like most of the grandstands, there is a pole in view. Luckily we have a clear shot of the entire infield:

Each game is $95; that price includes both of the two seats.
