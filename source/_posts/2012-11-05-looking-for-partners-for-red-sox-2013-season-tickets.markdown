I'm looking for partners for my 2013 Red Sox season ticket share. If you're interested in going to any games without paying ridiculous box office fees, fill out the form and I'll be in touch.<!--more-->

Though subject to change, tickets are currently in the infield grandstand, sec. 29, row 3 (behind third base).

Each game is $105, and includes two adjacent seats.
