An audibly-apt Brion fan over at [Fairfax Ave](http://www.fairfax-avenue.com) has done his best to transcribe the lyrics. If you can make out any parts that he couldn't, post a comment and I'll update them accordingly.

>Well I came from the burbs of Jersey one day when it was [turnin?]  
>I moved down to ?  
>I met a pretty good lover under the boardwalk and we made love  
>I thought that was all this world was made of  
>We thought if we could have ? highway ?  
>And I swear that Jenny, I couldn't have a worry anymore  
>It was knowing you're the one with the fire in your heart
>
>I knew it from the start  
>So come on, come on, come on  
>Baby wanna drink it up  
>I came all the way from Jersey  
>You're the only girl that I'm dreaming of  
>Nothing that you ever do could drive me away  
>That's all I got,  
>That's all I'm gonna say
>
>[Sensitive piano breakdown, really high]
>
>Now I know what you wanted, you want ? prom  
>And I'm gonna take that jacket, everything that I'm about  
>You know it's fat happy Pete  
>He went down to the convenience store  
>He's only living for a six pack, he don't live for nothing more  
>Well get in to my car it's a Dodge and it's got heat  
>We'll make love in the front and in the back seat  
>And there ain't noone in this world who's ever gonna hold us back  
>? [architect?]

>I come from Jersey,  
>I come from Jersey,  
>I come form Jersey,  
>I come from Jersey,  
>And let me tell you,  
>Let me tell you without a doubt  
>There's not that much to sing about
> 
>Whoah-ohâ€¦
