### Fender Rhodes 73 Mark I (Complete with top, legs and pedal)

Cosmetic blemishes as you'd expect for its age, but sounds fantastic and in tune. Action could use a tuneup but certainly very playable on day one. Has been humidified in home studio for last five years.

Photo is without top (I was inspecting when I took the photo), but rest assured it includes the original pedal, legs and top.
