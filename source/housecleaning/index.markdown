### 1924 Victor Victrola VV-215 78RPM Record Player

Price: $200

Note: This does NOT play modern records, only the old 78RPM ones.
You have to buy steel replacement needles regularly so it doesn't grind them.
It's fairly large and a bit heavy, so please understand what you're buying before you get home!

Condition: Physically worn and torn, mechanically flawless

### Kitchen Table and Chairs

Price: $200

Fold out table, seats four as shown, or six with lip folded out. Additional two chairs (unseen) **are** included (6 total).

Table itself is pretty worn. Looks great with a table cloth, but you'd probably want to refinish it if you want it bare.

Solid maple so you may need some help loading it into a vehicle.
