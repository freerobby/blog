### 1924 Victor Victrola VV-215 78RPM Record Player

Price: $200

Note: This does NOT play modern records, only the old 78RPM ones.
You have to buy steel replacement needles regularly so it doesn't grind them.
It's fairly large and a bit heavy, so please understand what you're buying before you get home!

Condition: Physically worn and torn, mechanically flawless
