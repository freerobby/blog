Hi, I'm Robby. I write mostly about startups and technology.

I oversee all things engineering at [Wistia](https://wistia.com).

Previously I oversaw engineering at [Shareaholic](http://shareaholic.com), founded [PaperPhobic](http://paperphobic.com), and worked as a developer at [oneforty](http://oneforty.com) (now part of [HubSpot](https://hubspot.com)), and [SAP](https://sap.com).

You can find me [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/freerobby) and [Github](http://github.com/freerobby), or reach me [via email](mailto:robby@freerobby.com).
